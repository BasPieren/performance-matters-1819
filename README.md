## API 🐒
I made use of the following API for this project:

* [SWAPI](https://swapi.co)

The Star Wars API allows you to get data on different Star Wars subjects like the movies, characters and planets. You can use a couple of different endpoints to access this data:
```js
{
    "films": "https://swapi.co/api/films/",
    "people": "https://swapi.co/api/people/",
    "planets": "https://swapi.co/api/planets/",
    "species": "https://swapi.co/api/species/",
    "starships": "https://swapi.co/api/starships/",
    "vehicles": "https://swapi.co/api/vehicles/"
}
